MEater ("Media Eater") is an upgraded version of TwEater (originally developed at https://github.com/dmonner/tweater), designed to allow addition of new types of media collection and analysis as well as recombining existing components into new configurations. It is very much a work-in-progress, but it's getting there!! 

If you want to try it out in its current state, you'll need to acquire and include all of the libraries found in the stock version of TwEater:

- DBPool-5.0.jar
- jchronic-0.2.3.jar
- jython.jar
- mail.jar
- mysql-connector-java-5.1.14-bin.jar
- PlyJy.jar

Plus the following additional libraries:

- commons-cli-1.2.jar
- commons-collections-3.2.1
- commons-configuration-1.10
- commons-lang-2.6
- commons-logging-1.1.1
- super-csv-2.2.0

...And the latest version of Twitter4J.

You will also need the Python NLTK library (also included in the original TwEater distribution) to use the sentiment analysis component, as well as its classifier + feature .pickle files.
